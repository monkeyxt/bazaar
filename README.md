# bazaar
p2p bazaar for cs 677

# Requirements
[Golang](https://golang.org)

# How to build
To build bazaar, run `go build`. The result should be an executable named `bazaar`.

## How to configure
The node can be configured with `bazaar.yml`. This is where the node gets information about peers, its role in the network, and items to buy or sell.

## How to test

### Milestone 1
Run `./test_all.sh` in the test folder

### Milestone 2
Run `./runtest.sh` in the `test5` and `test6` folder

For general testing, make a config file based on `/generatednodes/config.yaml`, put it in the test folder and use the `runtest.sh` bash to run the config file.
