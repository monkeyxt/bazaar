# Test 1

Test Description: Assign one peer to be a buyer of fish and another to be a seller of fish. Ensure that all fish is sold and restocked forever. In `test1config.yml`, the number of fishes for the seller node is assigned to 10 and the unlimited flag is set to true, so that fish is sold throughout.
\newline

\noindent Node Assignment:

nodes       address            role                sell                buy
--------    ----------------   ----------------    ----------------    ----------------
node0       localhost:10000    seller              fish (unlimited)    N/A
node1       localhost:10001    buyer               N/A                 fish
---------   ----------------   ----------------    ----------------    ----------------

\noindent Network Topology:
\newline

```{r echo=FALSE, dev='png', out.width="20%", fig.align='center'}
library("DiagrammeR")
grViz("
      digraph test {
        rankdir=LR;
        node [shape = circle]
        0, 1
        0 -> 1 [arrowhead = none];
      }
 ")
```

\noindent Program Behaviour: Buyer node `node1` continuously buys from seller node `node0`. The number of fish remaining for the seller goes from 10 to 0 and gets restocked once it hits 0.

# Test 2

Test Description: Assign one peer to be a buyer of fish and another to be a seller of fish and boar. Ensure that all fish is sold and restocked forever, but no boar is sold. In `test2config.yml`, the number of fishes for the seller node is assigned to 10 and the unlimited flag is set to true, so that fish is sold throughout. The number of boars for the seller node is also set to 10.

```

\noindent Program Behaviour: Buyer node `node1` continuously buys from seller node `node0`. The number of fish remaining for the seller goes from 10 to 0 and gets restocked once it hits 0. No boar is sold to `node1`.

# Test 3

Randomly assign buyer and seller roles. Ensure that items keep being sold throughout. In `test3config.yml`, the roles of the two nodes are set to `random`. The number of salt for the seller node is assigned to 1 and the unlimited flag is set to true, so that salt is sold throughout. The buyer target for the randomly chosen buyer node is set to salt.

        0, 1
        0 -> 1 [arrowhead = none];
      }
 ")
```

\noindent Program Behaviour: Salt is sold throughout and restocked if one node is a buyer and the other is a seller. No products are sold if both nodes have the same role.

# Test 4

One seller of boar, 3 buyers of boars, the remaining peers have no role. Fix the neighborhood structure so that buyers and sellers are 2-hop away in the peer-to-peer overlay network. Ensure that all items are sold and restocked and that all buyers can buy forever.

For each pair of goods there are two buyers, an unlimited seller and a seller with 10 stock. For all three goods there are three buyers and three unlimited sellers. See `test\test10config.yml` for more details.
